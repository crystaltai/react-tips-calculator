## Project summary

1/16/23

- I created a tips calculator using React to replicate the iPhone's tips calculator app
- The app allows users to input their initial cost, tip percentage, and the # of people to split the total cost amongst
- It utilizes `useState` hooks to preserve the various variables' values between function calls and `useEffect` to rerender calculation outputs when the inputs are changed
